## Linear and Non-Linear Programming
These are the my academic projects, using R to solve the linear and non-linear programming problems.  
Data is collected from an open source to serve the academic purposes.
The results and conclusion will be provided in the Rmarkdown files.

### Linear Programming:
Using **lpSolveAPI** and **igraph** to visualize the solutions, there will be three main problems solved within this scope:  
- Shortest path.
- Minimum cost.
- Maximum flow.

### Non-linear Programming:
In this part, I will demonstrate the Queuing Theory to solve a problem of an exihit involve with customers, printers (for newspapaer and posters) and inspectors ( inspecting the quality of the printers). These problems will rotating between increasing or decreasing the productivity of the printers in order to obtain the optimal outcome that match with the requirements of the exhibit.
