## Linear and Non-Linear Programming
These are the my academic project, using R to solve the linear and non-linear programming problems.  
Data is collected from an open source to serve the academic purposes.
The results and conclusion will be provided in a Rmarkdown file.

### Linear Programming:
Using **lpSolveAPI** and **igraph** to visualize the solutions, there will be three main problems solved within this scope:  
- Shortest path.
- Minimum cost.
- Maximum flow.

### Non-linear Programming:
In this part I will demonstrate the Queuing Theory to solve a problem of an exihit involve with customers, printers (for newspapaer and posters) and inspectors ( inspecting the quality of the printers). These problems will rotating between increasing or decreasing the productivity of the printers in order to obtain the optimal outcome that match with the requirements of the exhibit.  

### Limitation:
While working at this projects with other teamates, we found out that linear programming is heavily weighted on human labour. For example, to solve the minimum cost and maximum flow problem, our team had to manually typed hundread of numbers ( 0 and 1 most of the time) and it could be extremely confusing and hard to debug in case of syntax errors. Hence, this might significantly impact the quality of the work, and I personally eager to learn a proper way to solve linear problem without having to use overwhelmed human labour like this project.
